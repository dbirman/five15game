                <h2>Demo Copy Clarifications:</h2>
                <p>Thank you playtesters for trying out the demo copies! We're aggregating some clarifications and future changes here which will hopefully answer questions.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Clarifications of Rules:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>You can play as many setbacks/weather as you want on each climber during the Setback phase. You can also play as many Actions on yourself as you want during the Climb phase. </li>
                  <li>Setbacks and Weather persist when paused</li>
                  <li>You can't partner or be forced to partner on a 5.15</li>
                  <li>The Boulderer special ability means they only need to be 5.15 to flip cards from the 5.15 deck during the Crag phase.</li>
                  <li>(change) The dealer always flips a minimum of one climb during the Crag phase</li>
                  <li>(change) If you have to Epic and have no Gear you must discard another Booty card.</li>
                  <li>(change) You can only <b>hire a guide</b> at the <b>end</b> of the round. </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Climbs:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Realization (change): We weren't aware of the controversy about this climb, we're going to change the card to Bibliographie, Alex Megos' new 5.15d. The other 5.15 will probably be swapped to La Rambla, to celebrate Margo Hayes' historic climb.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Gear:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Hangboard (change): For each token on the hangboard gain +1 strength on boulder and sport. Start with one token. At the <b>end</b> of each subsequent round you may roll the dice: Roll a three or above, add another token; otherwise you get injured: discard this card and skip the next round.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Setbacks/Weather:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Biblical Flood affects all climbs, including your own if you are currently climbing. Always discard Biblical flood at the end of the round (even if someone is paused).</li>
                  <li>Have a Baby: The effect of this Setback is -2 climbing strength. The text is <i>flavor text</i> and has no effect on the game (it will be re-worded to be more clear).</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Actions:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Sticks & Stones / Hurts so Good: These do not block Weather, only Setbacks.</li>
                  <li>Free Solo can be played even if you were climbing this round. You skip the <b>following</b> rounds, not the current one. We plan to change this card in the final game.</li>
                  <li>Helicopter Drop Off and Drag a Partner are played on your turn during the Crag phase. They should say <b>Play when choosing your climbs</b> in the bottom right. </li>
                </ul>
